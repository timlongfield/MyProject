        As a kid, Tim loved flying remote control helicopers and taking photos.
        Over the last few years, drone technology has advanced tremendously, and
        this summer Tim decided to purchase DJI's Mavic Air 2 drone. With extra
        time during quarantine and over the summer, Tim recorded clips of boats
        and scenery around his lake house in New Hampshire. Combining the clips
        into an iMovie project, he recently published the video to YouTube.
